# here vars are declared in hosts file only, hosts file doesnot need to be the file in /etc/asnible/hosts 
# we can use from other path also 

# in playbooks folder create a folder named as inventory 
# give  a new file as hosts 
# give some entries (Private dns name )

# to declare our variables we need a diff path 

#where we host file thier create two folders 1 with group_vars
# 2nd with host_vars  this is the best approach for vraiable workout

#in group_vars create file Redhat.yaml here give the data
#  ---  
#  - package_name: httpd 

# Debian.yaml
# ---
# - package_name: apache2

# ansible-playbook -i "inventory/hosts" web2.yaml

# we no need to tell where is our variables are 
# why because in inventory folder we have group_vars it will read the variables from thier

# what is the use of host_vars folder then 

#group_vars is used for group of nodes to configure

#hosts_vars is used to configure single node 

# in hosts file under Debian group we have 2 nodes one is used for apache2 and other for nginx 
# so in hosts_vars create a file name under that host-name 

# ---
# - package_name: nginx 

#like this is used 


# now we may get a dought that under Debian we have 2 nodes 
# when we execute above cmd then it will install apche in that right 
# no it wont


# first group variable is read first then it will read hosts variable  what ever it reads last it will give first priority 

# the last read thing is -e whenever we pass the argumrnt
