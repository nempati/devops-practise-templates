ansible is a configuration managment tool 
it is a push model 
it requires credentilas of nodes to login 

#installing ansible in C M server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible

#insatlling python2.7  in nodes 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install pyhton

#adding user and passwd  inall machines 
adduser ansible
passwd ansible

#enabling passwd authentications in all machines
sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd.config
passwordauthentication:yes
service sshd restart

#giving root previligaes to ansible in all machines
sudo  #(become root user)
visudo
ansible (ALL)=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

#gen ssh key in C M server
su ansible 
cd ~
ssh-keygen

#copy this key into nodes

ssh-copy-id ansible@DNS_of_host
#by this above process we enable passwd less authentication
#for ansible to login from C M server to nodes

ssh ansible@hostname 

#by the above coomand CM machine logins into nodes with out passwd
# this is to  verify from us manually

# Inventory
it is located in /etc/ansible/hosts    in CM server 

this hosts file is the inventory for us to add DNS host names for ansible service to communicate with nodes

#playbooks
the yaml file which is used to configure the nodes attached to cm,  playbooks has plays which used modules to complete the tasks 
these modules are given by ansible 

ansible can be operated by cli and playbooks

when ever we want to control a single machine we use cli that process is called as ad-hoc commands

#a  basic palybook 

    #ping module
ping.yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: pinging all machines 
        ping:
ansible-playbook ping.yaml

## Installing git in all machines
git.yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing git
        apt: git
        state: present 

ansible-playbook git.yaml

#### installing apache server in ubuntu and restarting the service

apache.yaml

---
- hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing 
        apt: apache2
        state: present

    - name: restart apache2 service
        service: apache2
        state: restart


## gathering facts

ansible -m setup localhost 

- it gives all details about localhosts

# installing via ad-hoc commands

ansible -m apt "name=tree" --become
