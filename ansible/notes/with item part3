#  with_items  , commands module

i want to executr a installation but i have many things to install 

utilities.yaml

---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: installing utilities
      package:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: utilities

here i want to install 10 softwares at a time what can we do is copy tasks 10 times and give packages names 
but my packages name may keep changing

in debian file give a variable called utilities give packages names git, tree, nano and in redhat also also

to enter raw linux commands in playbooks we use a module which is not a idempotent  
(ref: command module)

commanddemo.yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: not
  tasks:
  - name: "create file "
    command: "touch /home/ubuntu/test.txt"
  - name: "store contents"
    command: echo "Hello" >> /home/ubuntu/test.txt
  - name: "diplay content"
    command: cat /home/ubuntu/test.txt
    register: file_content
  - debug:
      msg: "{{ file_content }}"
