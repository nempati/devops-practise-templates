custom image it is a image with our prefernces and objects we can create it and host 

how to build it what are its attributes  and commands 

    >   it is a dockerfile 
    >   it has some main attributes 
            . FROM :- this is a part where base image we use like ubuntu , redhat, tomcat , debian 
            . MAINTAINER :- group name or personal name
            . RUN :- to run commands such as apt yum and some other things 
            . COPY :- files or folders to copy into image from host pc
            . ADD :- files or folders to copy into image from host pc or from network
            . CMD : ["__" , "__"]
            . ENV :- environmentl variables to declare them 
            . EXPOSE :- port number of image to use
            . VOLUME :- 
            . WORKDIR :- TO AUTOMAticaly create a folder(s) or paths or changes starting directory
            . ARG can be called while building the image 

lets take an example of it 

FROM : ubuntu 14:04
RUN : apt update & apt install git -y 
RUN : apt install apache2 -y
COPY : some file into base folder of index.html file 
EXPOSE : 80
CMD : ["echo" , "its is done yaar"]

build this dockerfile 
        docker build -t my/apache2:0.1 . 

        -t it is tag we have given name and version for it 

        dot after name means the file path of docker file

if all arguments are sucess it builds or else it says it has a a error in a specific line 

run it and we will have that image runing 

.dockerignore :- create a file with this name in which we have created dockerfile and give the names of file you want to exclude coping
 into contianer image
