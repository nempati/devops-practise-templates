created  a  httpd container now to host a html file through that container

the index.html file location is /usr/local/apache/htdocs here remove the html file and copy the html file u want 

this httpd is a container iamge how to get into conatiner for editing some files 

to enter into docker container we must  execute the follawing command

docker exec -it conatiner_id /bin/bash

here it opens the bash terminal of the container as root no need of sudo act here it itself is root user so enter into any folder 
change the things you want and exit with by pressing ctrl+p+q this means read ezcape sequnace if we use exit keyword or ctrl+c it kills
the process


=============================================================================================================================================

now to use volumes for containers  

volumes: the path where we want to add a file(s) or folder(s)  while creating the conatiner 

what are the  uses of volumes we have a 5  files which are about 500mb which are also presnt in network location to download 
this same files are to be used in five different conatiners for scaling process so either downloading them in every conatiner we can copy
them into a specific folder where them must execute backdrop of volumes concept in docker conatiner is one same folder in host cant be used for 
diffrent containers 

docker run --name sqldb -p host_pc_port:conatiner_port -v host_pc_path:conatiner_path mysql -d 

here it creates a path between host machine to hosted conatiner for using it now if any file changes in any where i.e; in host or conatiner 
same files replicates in both areas now if this conatiner has issues we can create another conatinerwith same files and host it again this a
also worked as a backup
