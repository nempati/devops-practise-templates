docker networking:-

here we are not gooing to learn about network of linux machine or windows server its about docker network connection 

    swarm mode:-
docker swarm Docker Swarm is a clustering and scheduling tool for Docker containers. 
With Swarm, IT administrators and developers can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual system

in docker 1.12 and newer it is pre installed  swarm mode natively exits b/w os and conatiner images layers it helps in orchestartion 

clustering is an important feature for conatiner technology  which helps in providing reduandancy , b/w group of machines which are working 
to-gether, enabling docker swarm failover if one or more nodes outage is thier it also gives administrators privilage for reducing and increasing
containers


this used cni (conatiner network interface) for orchestartion when we want  to create  a network b/w docker which are in diffrent machines, which are reachable to each
other 


            multi-host overlay:-

    node1                                     node2                             node3                         node3
    (192.168.100.121)                         (172.182.68.36)                   (111.182.14.12)               (112.152.25.16)
    conatiner                                 conatiner                         conatiner                     conatiner
    (10.0.0.2)                                 (10.0.0.8)                       (10.0.0.11)                   (10.0.0.50)

                                                |                                       |
                                                |                                       | 
                                                |           overlay 10.0.0.0/24         |
                                                |                                       |


thier are 3 nodes which are in diffrent networks and are ping able to each other each node is installed with docker now to use swarm network  we need a overlay network
it is atype of network which looks like a physical network for conatiners they are in diffrent networks but look like they are in same network , it creates a tunnel 
where packets are transfered b/w each  conatiner they are connected with 


here we used  4 nodes in that one will be master and other will be working nodes 

in master  execute (docker swarm init)  we will get a token id copy into a notepad and use this tokken for joining worker nodes 

in rest of nodes paste this and execute and all the nodes get connected to master 

to see the nodes list in master execute this (docker nodes ls)

create a overlay network now (docker network create -d overlay somename)

this cerated a overlay and nodes are also in same overlay

to see network list (docker network ls)

now to deploy conatiner from master to nodes this is called as service 

in master (docker service create --name some_service_name --network overlay_name --replicas 2 image_name_of_docker )

(docker service ps service_name -manager)
